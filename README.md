# in-game-pro-shop
An Ethereum blockchain-based system for in-game purchases

## Status
Work in progress.

## Premise
An interesting potential for apps built on Ethereum is that they can
incorporate existing smart contracts that live on the blockchain.

For instance, Loom network's [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) feed on [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)
which are [non-fungible tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) created by another app entirely.

Meanwhile, in the gaming world, consider that Fortnite managed to
sell [over 1 billion dollars in in-game purchases](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-07-17-fortnite-has-earned-usd1-billion-from-in-game-purchases-alone) in less than a year
from it's inception.

Games like Fortnite are 'walled gardens' all the assets that gamers purchase
live on the company who wrote the game's server. With Ethereum, those
assets could live on the public blockchain, and be sold and traded like
CryptoKitties or any other NFT. And even better, game developers could
choose to allow assets from other games to be used in their own, simply
by choosing to support those NFTs.

The goal of In-game Pro Shop is to allow game developers to add in-game
purchases quickly with an existing system, and also to make it easy for
them to support assets from other games if they so choose.
